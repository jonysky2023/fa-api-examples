This repository contains examples of how to use the FlexxAnalyzer API. You can use this repository as a starting point for your own FlexxAnalyzer projects.

Please, refer to the [FlexxAnalyzer API documentation](https://docs.flexxanalyzer.com/dev/docs/) for more information.

The examples are organized in the following way:

- [typescript](./typescript) - contains examples of how to use the FlexxAnalyzer API in TypeScript
- [python](./python) - contains examples of how to use the FlexxAnalyzer API in Python

## Available examples

### TypeScript

- [User Apps](./typescript/user-apps): query the API to obtain all the apps used by a group of users over a specific period and export the results to a CSV file

### Python

- [User Experience](./python/User_experience.py): This code demonstrates how to make a GET request to an API using the Python library "requests". It defines variables for the "Customer ID" and "Bearer Token" required for authorization. The URL is constructed with the provided variables for pagination. The request is made with the specified headers and payload, and the response is printed using "pprint" for a more readable format.
